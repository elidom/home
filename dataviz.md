During the pandemic lockdown, I found [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md), an amazing online community dedicated to data visualization with the R Tidyverse. Each week, members produce creative visualizations from the same data set and share their code, making it easy for people like me to learn from others. Here, I share some of my contributions to this weekly activity.
