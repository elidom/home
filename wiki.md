I am contributing to the Wiki Page of the Neuropragmatics and Emotion Lab. While it is still in its early stages, we aim to collaboratively build a collection of technical tips that we find useful in the lab. This effort ensures that valuable knowledge and resources are readily accessible to current and future lab members.
