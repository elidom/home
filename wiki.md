I am contributing to the Wiki Page of the Neuropragmatics and Emotion Lab. While it is still in its early stages, we aim to collaboratively build a collection of resources that we find useful in the lab. This effort ensures that this valuable knowledge and resources are readily accessible to current and future lab members, as well as the wider community. The Wiki will also promote openness and consistency in the methods used by members of the lab. The Wiki is accessible [here](https://github.com/pell-lab/wiki/wiki).
