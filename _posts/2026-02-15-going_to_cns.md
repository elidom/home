Excited to share that I’ll be at the [Cognitive Neuroscience Society 2026 Annual Meeting](https://www.cogneurosociety.org/annual-meeting/) in Vancouver, where I’ll be presenting both a blitz talk and a poster. I’ll be sharing recent work from my PhD on how the brain encodes speech during real-time, naturalistic conversations of varying interactional quality.

I’d love to connect and exchange ideas.

### Title
Conversational engagement modulates neural speech tracking in real-time dialogue.
