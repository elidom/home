I am excited to announce my search for a postdoctoral research position starting in Fall 2025. My research has primarily centered around the neurocognitive processing of different types of speech in various social contexts. I am eager to continue exploring social interaction dynamics more broadly in a postdoctoral role.

I aim to collaborate with leading experts and contribute to innovative research in two-person neuroscience and cognitive and communication sciences. I offer:
- Expertise in conducting research at the intersection of **neuroscience**, **communication and speech science**, and **cognitive psychology**.
- Proficiency in **advanced statistical modeling** using R.
- Proficiency in **experimental design** and programming using MATLAB (and PsychToolbox) and JsPsych.
- Expertise in **neuroimaging** analysis techniques, especially event-related potentials (ERPs), EEG neural speech tracking, structural MRI, and (potentially soon) EEG hyperscanning.
- Experience in **teaching** and **mentoring** undergraduate students.
- Experience in **collaborating** with multiple teams and **leading** collaborative research projects.
- Experience with **acoustic analysis**.
- Experience **publishing** in peer-reviewed journals and **presenting** at international conferences.
- A **multicultural perspective** gained through international collaborations and research conducted across diverse cultural contexts.
