I am excited to announce my search for a postdoctoral research position starting in 2026. My research has primarily focused on understanding the neurocognitive processes underlying the perception and valuation of conversational speech in varied social contexts. I am eager to continue exploring social interaction dynamics more broadly in a postdoctoral role.

I aim to collaborate with leading experts and contribute to innovative research in two-person neuroscience and cognitive and communication sciences. I offer:
- Expertise in interdisciplinary research spanning **neuroscience**, **communication and speech science**, and **experimental psychology**.
- Advanced skills in **statistical modeling**, including **Bayesian approaches**, using R.
- Proficiency in **experimental design** and programming using MATLAB (and PsychToolbox) and JsPsych.
- Expertise in **neuroimaging** analysis techniques, especially event-related potentials (ERPs), EEG cortical speech tracking, structural MRI, and EEG hyperscanning.
- Proven experience in **teaching** and **mentoring** undergraduate students.
- Demonstrated ability to **collaborate** with multidisciplinary teams and **lead** collaborative research initiatives.
- Practical experience in **acoustic analysis** for speech and communication studies.
- Experience **publishing** in peer-reviewed journals and **presenting** at international conferences.
- A **global perspective** informed by international collaborations and cross-cultural research experiences.
