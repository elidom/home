We tend to naturally adapt to one another during real-time social interactions. This includes behavioral, emotional, and (neuro)physiological attunement. I am happy to coordinate a new biweekly Journal Club dedicated to discussing relevant recent findings on the mechanisms underlying interpersonal synchrony.  

Montreal is uniquely positioned as a hub for scholars from a wide range of disciplines who share an interest in interpersonal synchrony. Researchers here approach this topic from diverse perspectives, including social neuroscience, neurodiversity, music, and developmental studies, among others. This diversity creates a rare opportunity to bring these perspectives together, fostering rich discussions on the latest findings and cutting-edge methodologies in the field. This is what motivated me to start this journal club, with the goal of inspiring new research ideas and facilitating multidisciplinary collaborations.

The journal club will be hosted every other Friday by the Centre for Research on Brain, Language and Music (CRBLM; 2001 McGill College). If you are in Montreal and are interested in taking part, don't hesitate to [sign up!](https://forms.gle/9uAhoKD4irVFj5V46).
