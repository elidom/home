### The Brain Structural Correlates of Empathic and Emotion Regulation Capacities.
Experience shapes the brain. What is more, numerous research groups have shown that neuroimaging techniques can identify structural changes in the brain that correspond to varying external demands and individual differences. Such anatomical differences can be linked to capacities and experiences, such as spatial navigation (Maguire et al., 2000), music (Bermudez & Zatorre, 2005), and motor coordination (Draganski et al. 2004). My master's thesis project was concerned with whether experiences and skills in the social and affective domains could also be linked to anatomical differences in the cerebral cortex (although, as my wording implies, without establishing a causal link at this point). To investigate this, we used MRI scans to calculate the cortical thickness across the brains of professional psychotherapists and compared them to a control group. We chose to study psychotherapists because their training typically involves the ability to explicitly modulate their emotional response and they have been found to display increased empathic and emotion regulation skills. 

A strength of this study is that we used and compared two cortical thickness estimation pipelines: CIVET and FreeSurfer. Both methods provided evidence of a statistically significant difference between psychotherapists and non-therapists in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). This finding is meaningful because the dlPFC plays a crucial role in emotion regulation and cognitive empathy processes (e.g., empathic perspective-taking). Moreover, a structural covariance analysis revealed that in psychotherapists, the cortical thickness in this region varied relatively independently from the rest of the cortex.
