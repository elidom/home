### The Brain Structural Correlates of Empathic and Emotion Regulation Capacities.
Experience reshapes the brain. What is more, numerous research groups have shown that neuroimaging techniques can identify structural changes in the brain that correspond to varying external demands and individual differences. Such anatomical differences can be linked to greater capacities and experiences, such as spatial navigation (Maguire et al., 2000) or motor coordination (Draganski et al. 2004). My master's thesis project was concerned with whether experiences and skills in the social and affective domains could be linked to neuroanatomical differences (although, as my wording implies, without establishing a causal link at this point).
