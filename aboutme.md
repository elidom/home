title: About me
---

My name is Marcos E. Domínguez Arriola. I am a cognitive scientist interested in human communication, emotion, the brain, and the biobehavioral dynamics of inter-speaker synchronization. I grew up in the beautiful city of Guadalajara, Mexico—the birthplace of mariachi, tequila, and Guillermo del Toro. I earned my degree in psychology from the University of Guadalajara, where I conducted a dissertation on the cognitive processing of cute stimuli (e.g., kittens). After that, I discovered a passion for teaching and spent two years as a second-language instructor, teaching Spanish, English, and German in various academic and corporate settings. However, my longing for research remained strong. In 2019, I was accepted into the Institute of Neurobiology (INB) at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) to pursue a master’s degree. I worked under the supervision of Dr. Fernando Barrios to look at the neurostructural correlates of emotion regulation and empathic skills in psychotherapists.
