title: About me
---

My name is Marcos E. Domínguez Arriola. I am a PhD Candidate at the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders of McGill University, working under the supervision of Dr. Marc Pell at the Neuropragmatics and Emotion Lab. I am interested in human communication, emotion, the brain, and interpersonal biobehavioral synchrony. My current work mainly concerns our perception of value in spoken interactions. 

How can we index the perceived value of a conversation? What constitutes an engaging conversation and how do (extra)linguistic factors contribute to it? How do we modulate our voices when we want to promote a positive and sustained interaction? Is inter-speaker biobehavioral synchrony linked to a more rewarding conversation? These are some of the questions driving my research. You can read more about it under 'Research'. 

### My background
I grew up in the beautiful city of Guadalajara, Mexico — the cradle of mariachi, tequila, and Guillermo del Toro. I earned my degree in psychology from the University of Guadalajara, where I conducted a dissertation on the cognitive processing of cute stimuli (e.g., kittens). After that, I discovered a passion for teaching and spent two years as a second-language instructor, teaching Spanish, English, and German in various academic and corporate settings. However, my longing for research remained strong. 

In 2019, I was accepted into the Institute of Neurobiology (INB) at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) to pursue a master’s degree in neurobiology. I worked under the supervision of Dr. Fernando Barrios to look at the brain structural correlates of emotion regulation and empathic skills in psychotherapists using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During this time, I developed a passion for neuroimaging, coding, and data analysis.
